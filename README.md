# Mobile_Price_Finder

A Flask App which uses a ML model to predict the  price range of a mobile phone based on features preferred by
the user in a form. 
A support vector classifier is used to achieve our desired result as it gives a accuracy of about 96%.
The dataset upon which it was trained was valid upto 2018 and will only reflect the price range during that duration.
It is advisable not to use the above model as an inference.
