Battery_power: This feature represents the total energy a battery 
can store in milliampere-hours (mAh). It is measured in integer values.

Blue: This feature indicates whether the device has
Bluetooth capability or not. It's a binary feature where 1 typically 
means the device has Bluetooth, and 0 means it does not.

Clock_speed: This feature denotes the speed of the microprocessor 
in gigahertz (GHz). It's a float value representing the frequency of the CPU.

Dual_sim: This feature indicates whether the device supports 
dual SIM cards or not. Similar to the "blue" feature, it's binary, 
where 1 typically means the device supports dual SIM, and 0 means it doesn't.

Fc: This feature stands for "Front Camera" and represents 
the megapixels of the front camera of the mobile device. It's an integer value.

Four_g: Indicates whether the device supports 4G connectivity or not. It's also a binary feature.

int_memory: This feature represents the internal memory (RAM) of the device in gigabytes (GB). It's an integer value.

M_dep: Denotes the Mobile Depth, which refers to the thickness of the device. It's measured in float values.

Mobile_wt: Represents the weight of the mobile device in grams. It's an integer value.

N_cores: Indicates the number of cores in the device's processor. It's typically an integer value.

Pc: Stands for "Primary Camera" and represents the megapixels of the primary/back camera of the mobile device. It's an integer value.

Px_height: Represents the height of the device's display in pixels. It's an integer value.

Px_width: Represents the width of the device's display in pixels. It's an integer value.

Ram: Denotes the Random Access Memory (RAM) of the device in megabytes (MB). It's an integer value.

Sc_h: Stands for "Screen Height" and represents the height of the device's screen in centimeters. It's an integer value.

Sc_w: Stands for "Screen Width" and represents the width of the device's screen in centimeters. It's an integer value.

Talk_time: Represents the longest time that 
a single battery charge will last when you are using the phone for conversation. It's typically measured in hours.

Three_g: Indicates whether the device supports 3G connectivity or not. It's a binary feature.

Touch_screen: Indicates whether the device has a touch screen or not. It's a binary feature.

Wifi: Indicates whether the device supports Wi-Fi connectivity or not. It's a binary feature.

Price_range: This is the target variable. It represents the price
range of the mobile device. It's typically divided into categories 
(e.g., 0 for low cost, 1 for mid-range, 2 for high-end, etc.). In this dataset, 
it's an integer value representing different price ranges.
Price Range 0: $100 - $200
Price Range 1: $200 - $400
Price Range 2: $400 - $600
Price Range 3: $600 - $1000
